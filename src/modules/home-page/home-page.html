  <h1>Welcome to task home assignemnt EBANX</h1>
  <p>
    First of all, thank you all for letting me be part of this recruitment process, I enjoy every moment of this project and I would like you to enjoy it too. The language that I use is typescript with framework NestJS, for the deploy of this backend application and its database that I use postgres I use render, so this application has an expired data that is 01-apr-2024. I also use the best way to deacoplate everything and I create unit tests for every layer and integration tests for important points and for the architecture I based on Hexagonal Architecture, DDD, SOLID, clean coding.
